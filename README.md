# ANET

This repository is structured in two main, disparate components: the frontend and the backend. The frontend is a react.js based JavaScript application that communicates with the backend via XMLHttpRequest (ajax). The backend is a Java application based the Dropwizard framework that runs on a JVM and utilizes Microsoft SQL Server for its database.
